COPYING
=======
The characters, designs, etc. are inspired by Spiral Knights, which was
created by Three Rings. (And owned by SEGA?) Anyway, this is a fangame;
don't go selling it or touting it as your own creation. (Because, unless
you're one of the creators, it's not your creation.)

But you're welcome to distribute the game. Just don't tamper with this
file.
