In Spiralspy, Greaver was made 1.25 times bigger than it normally loads as.
This is probably because Greaver uses same rig as Silkwing, which is much
smaller. OOO probably just scales their Greavers to size.

Greaver is 0.62 as tall as Knight, if Greaver's wings are all the way down
	(And counting Greaver's horns)
Greaver's L/H is 1.4
Snipe is 0.42 as long as Greaver, from front to back wingtips


If characters fit in a 32x32 box, then...
Knight is 28 pixels tall. (4 pixel buffer...probably not enough space.)
Greaver is approx. 17 pixels tall, and with a 24 pixel length.
Snipe is 10 pixels long and just about that tall. (Might scale up.)
