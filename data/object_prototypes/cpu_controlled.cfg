// This prototype handles all AI in Slipstream. The point of doing
// this is to have all the AI in one place, making it easier to
// update the game's AI without changing multiple files.
//
// This isn't intended to be used alone; make sure to include some
// character prototype defining AI objects as well. (like "snipe")
//
// Settings which will be included for AI are AI difficulty (easier
// settings cause there to be random errors in the AI's judgements in
// distances.) and aggressiveness. (Some racers will have special
// abilities which activate when colliding with other racers; those
// racers will be aggressive.)
